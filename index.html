						<p>
							Over the years phones have become a more versatile mode of communication than they used to be. 
							We use them both for oral and text based communication (and have been doing so for a while now). 
						</p>
						<p>	
							And although there are a lot of people who can (or prefer to) use only one of both forms (oral or written), 
							when we ask for phone numbers in analog or digital forms, 
							we often don't give the formfiller the chance to tell us for which forms we can use their phone number.
							This creates bariers that could easily be avoided.

						<small>You don't need to fill in the example forms or answer the (rethorical) questions in the headers. Clicking submit will bring you to the next step of the demo.<br/>
